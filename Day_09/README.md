# üë®‚Äç‚öñ Auction Bidding Program

## Description
This Python program simulates an auction bidding system. Users (bidders) enter their name and bidding price. After all bids are placed, the program determines the highest bid and announces the winner.

### Features:
- **Multiple Bidders**: Allows multiple bidders to enter their names and bid amounts.
- **Clear Screen**: The screen is cleared after each new bidder for a clean interface (using `os.system('cls')` on Windows).
- **Highest Bidder**: Once all bids are collected, the program announces the highest bidder and their winning bid.
