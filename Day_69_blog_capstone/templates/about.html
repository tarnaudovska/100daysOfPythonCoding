          After over a decade of experience in the computer graphics (CG)
          industry, I've discovered a newfound passion for Python programming.
          Through recent learning experiences, I've come to appreciate Python's
          versatility in automating tasks and customizing tools, enabling me to
          creatively solve problems and optimize workflows. This revelation has
          inspired me to fully transition into Python programming and software
          engineering, where I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative
          projects and continue to grow in this dynamic field. The prospect of
          working in Python-driven environments excites me, as it represents a
          natural progression of my ability to blend technical proficiency with
          creativity.

          To kickstart my Python journey, I immersed myself in two comprehensive
          Udemy courses: "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"
          and "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python." These
          courses provided me with a solid foundation across a diverse range of
          tools and technologies. I honed my skills in Python development
          environments like PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook, learned automation
          with Python scripting, and explored game development, data science
          tools like Pandas, GUI creation with Tkinter, and web development
          using Flask, REST APIs, and SQLAlchemy. Additionally, I gained
          valuable experience in front-end development with HTML5, CSS3, and
          Bootstrap, as well as backend processes including web authentication
          and database management. Through this journey, I’ve also embraced
          version control practices with Git and GitHub to manage my projects
          effectively.

          I am deeply motivated to apply my growing Python expertise in
          meaningful and challenging contexts. My GitHub portfolio, which
          showcases my projects and development progress, reflects my dedication
          to continuous learning and improvement. With a strong technical
          background and a proven ability to adapt and innovate, I am excited to
          contribute to impactful software engineering initiatives. You can
          explore my work at GitHub link, which highlights the diverse projects
          I’ve undertaken and the breadth of skills I bring to the table.
