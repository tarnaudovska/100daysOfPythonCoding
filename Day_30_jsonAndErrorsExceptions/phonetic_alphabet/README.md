# Phonetic Alphabet Generator

This Python script generates the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of a word provided by the user.

## How It Works:
1. The program loads a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet.
2. It converts the word entered by the user into uppercase.
3. It creates a list of phonetic code words based on each letter in the word.
4. If the user enters a non-alphabetic character, the program asks for a new word until a valid one is provided.
