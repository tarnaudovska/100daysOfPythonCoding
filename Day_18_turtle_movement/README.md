## File Descriptions

### 1. 🐢 `turtle_square_random.py`

#### Description
This script creates a random walk pattern with the Turtle. The turtle:
- Moves in random directions (`0`, `90`, `180`, `270` degrees).
- Changes its color randomly after each move.

#### Key Features
- **Random Colors**: Uses `turtle.colormode(255)` and the `random` module to generate RGB colors.
- **Random Walk**: The turtle selects random directions and moves forward, leaving a trail of colors.
- **Customizations**: You can adjust:
  - The number of steps (currently 100).
  - The distance for each step (currently 50).

### 2. 🐢 `turtle_square_pattern.py`

#### Description

This script creates geometric patterns using the Turtle. The turtle:

- Draws polygons with increasing sides.
- Selects a random color from a predefined list.
